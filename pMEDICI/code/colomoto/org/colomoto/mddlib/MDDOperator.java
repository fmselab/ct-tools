 * Definition of operators that can be used to combine MDD nodes.
 * <p>
 * An operator typically takes two nodes from the same MDDManager, and returns a node
 * representing the combination of the input nodes.
 * <p>
 * For Boolean nodes, classical operators include "AND", "OR", "XOR"...
 * Here we aim to encourage custom operators to take advantage of multi-valued nodes or
 * to perform specialised operations.
